The **Swim System** Java implementation provides a self-contained distributed
software platform executing stateful Web Agent applications.  **Swim System**
incorporates the [**Swim Core**](swim-core-java) foundation framework, the
[**Swim Mesh**](swim-mesh-java) distributed microkernel and Web Agent framework,
and the [**Swim Polyglot**](swim-polyglot-java) multi-language virtual machine
framework.

## Umbrella Framework

The **Swim System** umbrella framework provides a self-contained distributed
software platform for building stateful, massively real-time streaming
applications that run on any Java 8+ VM.  **Swim System** has no external
dependencies beyond a minimal JVM.

## Usage

To embed the **Swim Kernel** directly into your application, add the
**swim-server** library to your project's dependencies.

### Gradle

```groovy
compile group: 'org.swimos', name: 'swim-server', version: '3.10.0'
```

### Maven

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.swimos</groupId>
  <artifactId>swim-server</artifactId>
  <version>3.10.0</version>
</dependency>
```

## Development

**SwimOS** runs on any Java 8+ VM with a minimal `java.base` classpath.
**SwimOS** uses [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) as its standard build system.
The included `gradlew` script can be used to build the platform.

### Setup

Install a Java 8+ JDK, such as [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/) or
[GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/downloads/).

### Compiling sources

```sh
swim-system-java $ ./gradlew compileJava
```

### Running tests

```sh
swim-system-java $ ./gradlew test
```

### Building documentation

```sh
swim-system-java $ ./gradlew :javadoc
```

### Setting up a checkstyle commit hook
